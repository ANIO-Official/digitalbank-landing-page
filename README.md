# SBA 3 Design and Development
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to demo utilizing CSS libraries, specifically Bootstrap, in web development. This project is focused on:
-Utilize Bootstrap to streamline styling in my code.
-Apply Bootstrap responsive utilties to create responsive layouts.
-Minimize my CSS file usage.

[This is features a solution to the Digital Bank Landing Page FrontEnd Mentor Challenge.]

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is one of many popular CSS Libraries available to help streamline the styling process.

### Challenge

## Digital Bank Landing Page

### GitHub Link

## My process
  1. Added the Base files to the repository and initialize git repository.
  2. Placed an inital Bootstrap grid and HTML semantic elements to make a base setup.
  3. Placed provided challenge content into the respective places.
  4. Continuously styled, browser tested, and repeat until page setup is similar to design.
  5. Placed image assets, designed buttons, added background colors.
  6. Continuous tweaking of elements' padding, margins, and sizing to match design using Bootstrap and CSS (as needed).
  7. Review code and reorganize as necessary. Add any missing details.
  8. Work on making code responsive and change areas of need utilizing Bootstrap breakpoint setup.
  9. README added and Challenge README rename.
  *I continuously looked through references throughout this whole process. As Bootstrap can be confusing at times due to it's mobile first approach. sm does not mean for small screens. It starts at applies to that specific small screen size AND everything larger.*

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap CSS Library

## Reflection

  **Challenges**
  I faced quite a few challenges during this project:
  1. There was no figma file as part of the free challenge, aside from some font size and color notes in the style guide. This led to a lot of guesswork for the exact placement of elements. 
  2. Bootstrap is very limited in the way it uses breakpoints for some elements. 
  3. At one point my images did not show up.

  **Solutions**
  1. I did my best to eyeball placements. I also checked out some solutions on FrontEnd Mentor using their comparison image dragger to see how they visually ended up looking. I also repeatedly referenced the provided design images. I tried to ensure elements were in the places they were relative to each other, rather than the page itself.
  2. To rememdy where Bootstrap fell short in breakpoints, I used CSS & CSS media query to change parts such as background colors, font sizes, heights, widths, margins, and paddings.
  3. I closed the opened html file and reopened it. It solved the issue mysteriously.
  
  **Improvements**
  If given more time, I would add the dark/light mode feature, a usable drop down toggle for the nav bar, and I would start with the Bootstrap grids first. I initally thought I planned out the grids well but after reasearching more while coding, I realized I misunderstood some areas about how Bootstrap's responsive rows and columns worked so I had to go back and fix mistakes.

  I'm proud of the Desktop Version the most. This was a challenging project, so finishing what I could left me proud.
  
### What I learned
Personally, from this experience, I believe CSS libraries like Bootstrap should be cherry picked for it's most useful features *by project*. By this I mean, when planning out how to go about creating a project, creating a responsive wireframe of the layout in html using Bootstrap can help.  I found that I was able to get back into flow best when I went above my main code at times and tested out something I saw in a reference before applying it to what I had already coded. Though if I had done this more with Bootstrap's responsive grid, I would've had an easier time setting up the mobile version.
Bootstrap and other libraries, work best when paired with CSS to make up for where the other lacks.

- [Adrian Twarog Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqu-d_b3K-0&t=75s) - This video helped a lot with further explaining grid in Bootstrap. It also linked to the version 5.0 documentation for Bootstrap which I found a bit easier to understand as it provided an example sheet. I also revisited this one.
- [Grid Example Sheet 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/grid) This version of the visualization was clearer for me to read. I revisited it.
